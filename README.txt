Explanation of Project:
This is Project2 of CSC 172, which covers Infix to Postfix conversion.
The project instructs us to implement a calculator that takes a text file of mathematical expressions
and converts it from infix notation to postfix notation. Then, it evaluates the postfix form of the expressions,
and outputs the results in another text file using file I/O in the terminal.

Extra Credit Implemented:
Implemented modulo and sin operations.
Also, took in account several input exceptions including division by zero, undefined letters and symbols, and improper inputs for '&', '|', '!'.

Explanation of Files in Zip Folder:
‘InfixCalculator.java’ contains the class that represents the InfixCalculator, and
‘DoublyLinkedList.java’ contains the doubly linked list inferface, and
‘MyDoubleNode.java’ contains my node for doubly linked list that I made in lab5, and
‘MyDoublyLinkedList.java’ contains my doubly linked list class that implements 'DoublyLinkedList.java' interface from lab5, and
‘MyLinkedList.java’ contains my linked list class that implements 'SimpleLinkedList.java' inferface from lab4, and
‘MyQueue.java’ contains my queue class that implements 'Queue.java' interface from lab7, and
‘MyStack.java’ contains my stack class that implements 'Stack.java' interface from lab6, and
‘Queue.java’ contains queue interface, and
‘Stack.java’ contains stack interface, and
‘SimpleLinkedList.java’ linked list interface, and
‘MyNode.java’ contains my node for linked list that I made in lab4, and
‘infix_expr_short.txt’ contains the test cases given in the instructions, and
‘postfix_eval_short.txt’ contains my results from these test cases, and
‘postfil_eval_short_official.txt’ contains the official (correct) results for these test cases, and
‘extended_test_cases.txt’ contains more test cases that I created, and
‘extended_tc_output.txt’ contains the results to these test cases showcasing some extra credit that I completed, and
‘OUTPUT.txt’ contains the compile and run steps of my code, and
'OUTPUT.png' is a screenshot of the compile and run steps of my code, and
‘OUTPUT_OF_EXTENDED_TEST_CASES.txt’ is a screenshot the results from running InfixCalculator.java on ‘extended_test_cases.txt’, and
'OUTPUT_OF_INFIX_EXPR_SHORT.png' is a screenshot of the results from running InfixCalculator.java on ‘infix_expr_short.txt’.
